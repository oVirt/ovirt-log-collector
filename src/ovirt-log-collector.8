.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

The \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP command gathers data from many different components (logs, databases, and environmental information) associated with an instance of a oVirt Enterprise Virtualization Engine Manager. The tool is intended to be run from the Linux system on which the is running as the root user.\&

.PP
The \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP will, by default, attempt to interact with the oVirt Engine REST API. This command typically gets the oVirt Engine's hostname and port number (engine=) and user name (user=) from the \fB/etc/engine/logcollector.conf\fP file. Alternatively, you can provide the user name and password from the command line. The user name and password are authenticated by the authentication service associated with the oVirt Engine.  Currently, a special local account (admin), Red Hat IPA server, and Microsoft Active Directory server is supported for this task.
.PP

Central to the \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP command is a series of plug\-ins to the \fBsosreport\fP(1) application. These plug\-ins and other components gather information about hypervisors managed by the oVirt Engine into a single archive (a sort of \fBsosreport\fP(1) of sosreports).

.PP

The \fBlist\fP option lists hypervisors controlled by the oVirt Engine, while \fBcollect\fP (default) actually runs the collection. The result of running \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP is a compressed archive that contains logs and other information from some or all of the following:

.\"TODO: Describe engine\-slimmed

.IP "\fB* Hypervisor Log Collection\fP"

Logs from all nodes managed by the oVirt Engine are gathered by default. The \-\-no\-hypervisors option lets you choose to not collect any hypervisor information. Other options let you limit log collection to specific clusters, data centers or hosts. Some options require that the log collector communicate with the oVirt Engine RESTful API. The communication is needed to retrieve the list of hosts in a cluster or datacenter, and is transparent to the user.\&

.IP "\fB* PostgreSQL Log Collection\fP"

Log collector always tries to get some PostgreSQL information. Using a PostgreSQL \fBsosreport\fP(1) plug\-in, log collector gathers all logs in POSTGRE_HOME and optionally dumps a designated database if a username and password are supplied. PostgreSQL reports are prefixed with postgre\-. For example:\&

postgresql\-sosreport\-rhel6\-20110613221045\-f914.ta r.xz.\&

.IP "\fB* Clock Skew\fP"

To deal with cases where hypervisors are not syncronized with NTP, a file called time_diff.txt is created to list the clock skew of each hypervisor relative to the oVirt Engine.  This file is included in the report whenever you elect to collect information from a hypervisor.

.PP

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"

.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP"

Display verbose output.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-output\fP"

Destination directory where the report will be stored.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-include\-sensitive\-data\fP"

Avoid to obfuscate sensitive data like passwords, etc.
The generated archive will contain data considered sensitive
and its content should be reviewed by the originating
organization before being passed to any third party.

.IP "\fB\-\-package\-manager\-history\fP"

Includes the yum or dnf history data. It might increase the
time to collect the data per transaction.

.SH "oVirt Engine CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
The options in the oVirt Engine configuration group can be used to filter log collection from one or more hypervisors. If the \-\-no\-hypervisors option is specified, data is not collected from any hypervisor. Wild card globbing (*, ?, []) can be used to match names.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-hypervisors\fP"

Skip all collection from hypervisors (default=False).\&

.IP "\fB\-\-hypervisor\-per\-cluster\fP"

Collect data from one hypervisor per cluster. Select the Spm if found in a cluster.\&

.IP \fB\-\\-time\-only\fP"

Just gather time diff from specified hypervisors

.IP "\fB\-u user@engine.example.com, \-\-user=user@engine.example.com\fP"

Indicates the user name to use with the REST API. This should be in UPN format.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-with\-kerberos\fP"

Enables Kerberos authentication instead of the default basic authentication.\&

.IP "\fB\-r engine.example.com, \-\-engine=engine.example.com\fP"

Hostname or IP address of the oVirt Engine (default=localhost:443).\&

.IP "\fB\-c CLUSTER, \-\-cluster=CLUSTER\fP"

Replace CLUSTER with a pattern or comma\-separated list of patterns, to filter the host list by cluster name (default=None).\&

.IP "\fB\-d DATACENTER, \-\-data\-center=DATACENTER\fP"

Replace DATACENTER with a pattern, or comma separated list of patterns, to filter the host list by data center name (default=None).\&

.IP "\fB\-H HOST_LIST, \-\-hosts=HOST_LIST\fP"

Replace HOST_LIST with a pattern, or comma separated list of hostnames, hostname patterns, FQDNs, FQDN patterns, IP addresses, or IP address patterns from which the log collector should collect hypervisor logs (default=None).\&

.SH "SSH CONFIGURATION"
The options in the SSH configuration group can be used to specify the maximum number of concurrent SSH connections to hypervisors(s) for log collection, the SSH port, and a identity file to be used.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-ssh\-port=PORT\fP"

The port used for ssh and scp communications.\&

.IP "\fB\-k KEYFILE, \-\-key\-file=KEYFILE\fP"

The identity file (private key) to be used for accessing the hypervisors (default=/etc/pki/engine/keys/engine_id_rsa). If an identity file is not supplied the program will prompt for a password. It is strongly recommended to use key\-based authentication with SSH because the program may make multiple SSH connections resulting in multiple requests for the SSH password.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-max\-connections=MAX_CONNECTIONS\fP"

Maximum concurrent connections for fetching hypervisor logs (default=10).\&

.SH "POSTGRESQL DATABASE CONFIGURATION"
The log collector will connect to the oVirt Engine PostgreSQL database and dump the data for inclusion in the log report, unless \-\-no\-postgresql is specified. The PostgreSQL user ID and database name can be specified if they are different from the defaults. If the PostgreSQL database is not on the localhost, set pg\-dbhost, provide a pg\-ssh\-user, and optionally supply pg\-host\-key and the log collector will gather remote PostgreSQL logs. The PostgreSQL \fBsosreport\fP(1) plug\-in must be installed on pg\-dbhost for successful remote log collection.\&

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-postgresql\fP"

This option causes the tool to skip the postgresql collection (default=false).\&

.IP "\fB\-\-pg\-user=postgres\fP"

PostgreSQL database user name (default=postgres).\&

.IP "\fB\-\-pg\-dbname=engine\fP"

PostgreSQL database name (default=engine).\&

.IP "\fB\-\-pg\-dbhost=localhost\fP"

PostgreSQL database hostname or IP address (default=localhost).\&

.IP "\fB\-\-pg\-ssh\-user=root\fP"

The SSH user that will be used to connect to the server upon which the remote PostgreSQL database lives (default=root).\&

.IP "\fB\-\-pg\-host\-key=none\fP"

The identity file (private key) to be used for accessing the host upon which the PostgreSQL database lives (default=not needed if using localhost).\&

.SH "EXAMPLES"
Before running \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP to collect data, you should run one or more list commands, to hone in on the data you want. Here's an example of the the output using a list option to see all hosts managed by the oVirt Engine:

.PP

# \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP list

.br

Please provide the password for engine (CTRL+D to abort):  ********
.br
Host list (datacenter=None, cluster=None, host=None):
.br
Data Center          | Cluster              | Hostname/IP Address
.br
Legacy               | LegacyCluster        | 192.168.122.11
.br
Legacy               | NewCluster           | 192.168.125.42

Use the \-\-hosts= option to limit output to a particular host or group of hosts (using wildcards, as needed).

.PP

# \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP list \-\-hosts=*.11

.br

Please provide the password for engine (CTRL+D to abort):
.br
Host list (datacenter=None, cluster=None, host=set(['*.11'])):
.br
Data Center          | Cluster              | Hostname/IP Address
.br
Legacy               | LegacyCluster        | 192.168.122.11

.PP

Instead of having log collector collect logs from all hypervisors managed by the oVirt Engine (default), you can use the same options you used with \fBlist\fP to limit data collection to specific hosts (or datacenters or clusters). Here, all hosts with IP addresses ending in .11 are matched:\&

.PP

# \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP collect \-\-hosts=*.11

.br

Please provide the password for engine (CTRL+D to abort):
.br
About to collect information from 1 hypervisors. Continue? (Y/n): \fBY\fP
.br
INFO: Gathering information from selected hypervisors...
.br
INFO: Collecting information from 192.168.122.11
.br
.PP

To gather data, from multiple hosts, provide a comma\-separated list of addresses or host names. The following example gathers data from all hosts ending in .11 or .15:\&

.PP

# \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP collect \-\-hosts=*.11,*.15

.PP

Use the cluster option to gather data based on cluster name. Here, information on all hosts with IP addresses ending in .11 or .15 are matched from any cluster beginning with the letter L (using * as a wild card):\&

.PP

# \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP collect \-\-cluster=L* \-\-hosts=*.11,*.15

.PP

Likewise, you can gather data based on data center. Here, all hosts from the example.com domain are matched from any data center beginning with the letter L (using * as a wild card):\&

.PP

# \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP collect \-\-data\-center=L* \-\-hosts=*.example.com

.br

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
To get configuration information, \fBovirt\-log\-collector\fP refers to the \fB/etc/engine/logcollector.conf\fP configuration file. To set defaults for any of the options described in this man page, uncomment the settings you want in this file. Here examples of a few lines from that file:

.PP
